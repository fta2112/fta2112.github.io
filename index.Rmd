Hi, I'm Feben Asefaha. I'm currently a Master's student in Biostatistics at [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics).

Before that, I worked as a vector biologist for New York City's [Health Department](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/index.page).

I obtained my BS from Cornell University in 2015.
